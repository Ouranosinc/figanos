New features and enhancements
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
* `figanos` now supports Python 3.12. (:pull:`210`).
* Use list or ndarray as levels for colorbar in gridmap and small bug fixes (:pull:`176`).
* Added style sheet ``transparent.mplstyle`` (:issue:`183`, :pull:`185`)
* Fix ``NaN`` issues, extreme values in sizes legend and added ``edgecolors`` in ``fg.matplotlib.scattermap``  (:pull:`184`).

* New argument ``enumerate_subplots`` for `gridmap`, `timeseries`, `hatchmap` and `scattermap`(:pull:`220`).
* ``fg.taylordiagram`` can now accept datasets with many dimensions (not only `taylor_params`), provided that they all share the same `ref_std` (e.g. normalized taylor diagrams)  (:pull:`214`).
* A new optional way to organize points in a ``fg.taylordiagram``  with  `colors_key`, `markers_key`  : DataArrays with a common dimension value or a common attribute are grouped with the same color/marker (:pull:`214`).
* Heatmap (``fg.matplotlib.heatmap``) now supports `row,col` arguments in `plot_kw`, allowing to plot a grid of heatmaps. (:issue:`208`, :pull:`219`).
* New function ``fg.matplotlib.triheatmap`` (:pull:`199`).
* Reorganized the documentation and add gallery (:issue:`278`, :issue:`274`, :issue:`202`, :pull:`279`).
* Added a new `pooch`-based mechanism for fetching and caching testing data used in the notebooks (``fg.pitou().fetch()``). (:pull:`279`).
* No-legend option in ``hatchmap``; use ``edgecolor`` and ``edgecolors`` as aliases (:pull:`195`)

Breaking changes

* `cartopy` has been pinned above v0.23.0 due to a licensing issue. (:pull:`210`).
* `twine` and `wheel` have been removed from the ``dev`` requirements. (:pull:`210`).
* ``fg.taylordiagram`` returns a tuple of `(fig, floating_ax, legend)` instead of only `floating_ax`. (:pull:`214`).

.. _changes_0.3.0:

v0.3.0 (2024-02-16)
-------------------
Contributors to this version: Sarah-Claude Bourdeau-Goulet (:user:`Sarahclaude`), Pascal Bourgault (:user:`aulemahal`), Trevor James Smith (:user:`Zeitsperre`), Juliette Lavoie (:user:`juliettelavoie`), Gabriel Rondeau-Genesse (:user:`RondeauG`).

New features and enhancements
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
* New function ``fg.matplotlib.hatchmap`` (:pull:`107`).
* Support for translating figures. Activating a locale through `xclim`'s ``metadata_locales`` option will try to use metadata saved by `xclim` or `xscen` in this locale and to translate common terms appearing in the figures. `figanos` currently ships with French translations of those terms. (:pull:`109`, :issue:`64`).
* New ``figanos.Logos`` class added to manage and install logos stored in user's Home configuration directory. The ``figanos.utils.plot_logo`` function call signature has changed to support the new system. (:issue:`115`, :pull:`119`).
* Logo sizing and placement now depends on `scikit-image` for resizing, and uses ``"width"`` and ``"height"`` instead of ``"zoom"``. (:issue:`123`, :pull:`119`).
* Logo plotting now supports both PNG and SVG file types (via `cairosvg`). (:pull:`119`).
* Use small geojson in the notebook. (:pull:`124`).
* Add the Colours of Figanos page (:issue:`126`, :pull:`127`).
* Figanos now adheres to PEPs 517/518/621 using the `flit` backend for building and packaging. (:pull:`135`).
* New function ``fg.partition`` (:pull:`134`).
* Add wrapper around ``xarray.plot.facetgrid`` for map functions (``fg.gridmap``, ``fg.scattermap``, ``fg.hatchmap``). (:issue:`51`, :pull:`136`).
* `figanos` now uses `Semantic Versioning v2.0 <https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html>`_. (:pull:`143`).
* Add wrapper around ``xarray.plot.facetgrid`` for multiple functions (``fg.gridmap``, ``fg.scattermap``, ``fg.hatchmap``, ``fg.timeseries``). (:issue:`51`, :pull:`136`).

Bug fixes
^^^^^^^^^
* Fixed packaging issue with the `Manifest.in` not bundling a YAML file loaded on import. (:pull:`118`).

Internal changes
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
* Clean up of the dependencies to remove the notebooks deps from the core deps.
* `figanos` now uses Trusted Publishing to publish the package on PyPI and TestPyPI. (:pull:`113`).
* The official Ouranos logos have been removed from the repository. They can now be installed if required via the ``figanos.Logos.install_ouranos_logos`` class method. (:issue:`115`, :pull:`119`).
* Documentation adjustments. (:pull:`121`):
    * Added a few `pre-commit` hooks for cleaning up notebooks and ensuring that docstrings are properly formatted.
    * Cleaned up the docstrings of a few functions, added some module-level strings, minor typo fixes.
    * Set `nbsphinx` in the documentation to always run (with th exception of one complex cell).
    * The `environment-dev.yml` Python version is set to `3.11` to reduce the dependency solver complexity.
* The `cookiecutter` template has been updated to the latest commits via `cruft`. (:pull:`138`, :pull:`143`):
    * `Manifest.in`, `requirements_dev.txt`, `requirements_docs.txt` and `setup.py` have been removed.
    * `pyproject.toml` has been added, with most package configurations migrated into it.
    * `HISTORY.rst` has been renamed to `CHANGES.rst`.
    * `dependabot` has been added to the GitHub workflows to manage workflow and package dependency pins.
    * `bump-version.yml` has been added to automate patch versioning of the package.
    * `pre-commit` hooks have been updated to the latest versions; `check-toml` and `toml-sort` have been added to cleanup the `pyproject.toml` file.
    * `ruff` has been added to the linting tools to replace most `flake8` and `pydocstyle` verifications.
    *  GitHub workflows now run proper pytest suites for `conda`-based testing.
    * `figanos` now uses the `actions/labeler` action to automatically label pull requests based on their content.
    * GitHub workflows are now using the `step-security/harden-runner` action to harden the runner environment.
    * The OpenSSF `scorecard.yml` workflow has been added to the GitHub workflows to evaluate package security.

Bug fixes
^^^^^^^^^
* Fixed an issue with the `divergent` argument getting ignored (:pull:`132`).
